To solve the frame problem PDDL specifies the result of an action in terms of what changes while everything else that stays the same is left unmentioned. 
Disadvantages to formulating problems in PDDL is that PDDL does not have a universal quantifier which means that objects similar but originally defined separate need to be individually quantified when envoking actions on the objects.
